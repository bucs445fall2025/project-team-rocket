## Sprint 6 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

User Interface Requirements, Post Management System, Admin Functionality

### User Story

Epic: Internship Posting and Administration
- As a student, I want to post internship opportunities so that I can share valuable opportunities with other students
- As a student, I want to edit or delete my own posts so that I can keep information accurate and up-to-date
- As an admin, I want to manage posts and reports so that I can keep the platform clean and useful

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

Frontend internship posting functionality
Backend API endpoints for creating and managing internship posts
Admin panel for post and report management
Integration of posting system with authentication

### Completed Requirements

Got the posting system working - users can create, edit, and delete their posts. Built the admin panel with two parts: one for handling reports and one for managing all posts. Admins can look at reported posts, delete bad ones, and bring back posts that were deleted by mistake. Everything works with the login system we built earlier.

### Incomplete Requirements

None - all planned functionality for posting and admin management was completed successfully.

### The summary of the entire project

We are creating a web app where students can share and find internship opportunities. Users can post internships with details like company, description, and tags, and others can comment or upvote them. The goal is to make it easier for students to discover real, useful internships all in one place. We're building with React frontend, Flask backend, and SQLite database. The app now has full posting, voting, commenting, reporting, and admin management capabilities.

## Sprint 7 Planning

## Requirements Flex

3/3 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

None from previous sprint - posting and admin systems were completed successfully.

### Requirement Target

User Interface documentation and refinement
Complete all screen interfaces and user flows
Finalize user experience and interface consistency

### User Stories

User interface work and debugging

### Planning

Take screenshots of all our screens and write up descriptions for each one. Test everything on our phones and laptops to make sure it looks good. Fix any weird UI stuff we find. Add all the interface docs to the SRS.

### Action Items

- Add User Interface section to SRS with all screen documentation - Done
- Test all the pages on different screen sizes
- Make sure styling looks the same on all pages
- Get all the interface documentation done with screenshots

### Issues and Risks

- Screenshots might need to be retaken if we change any screens
- Mobile stuff might need some tweaking

### Team Work Assignments

Alex: Test frontend stuff, make sure mobile works, fix UI problems
Vaughn: Update SRS docs, write interface descriptions, review all documentation  
Vishil: Test backend API, check interface integration, fix bugs
