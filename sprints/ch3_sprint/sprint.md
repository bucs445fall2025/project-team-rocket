# **Project Overview**

## **Application Vision/Goal:**
[Describe the overall purpose and vision of the application. What problem does it solve? Who is the target audience?]
We want to build a website where students can share and find internships. Right now, a lot of info gets spread out across emails, Discord, LinkedIn, or random group chats, and its all over the place and hard to manage, but by creating a Internship Hub, everything’s in one place and easier to find allowing students to share opportunities and tips to help each other out.
## **Scope:**
[List the major features and functionalities that define the scope of the project. Keep this high-level to avoid feature creep.]
Students can post internships with a link, title, description, and tags (like “Software Engineering,” “NYC,” or “Fall 2025”).

Users can comment under a post to add info like deadlines, interview tips, or personal experiences they may have.

A voting system lets people upvote the most helpful opportunities to spread important and trending opportunities or chats.

Search and filters help find posts by company, role, or tags.

Users can report broken links or expired posts so the board stays clean.
## **Deliverables:**
[List what will be delivered by the end of the project, such as a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), specific features, documentation, etc.]
A working MVP web app.

Core features:

Posting internships with title, description, tags, and link.

Commenting on posts.

Voting system so the most useful internships rise to the top.

Search and filter functionality (by keyword, company, and tags).

Reporting feature for not working/expired opportunities.

A simple login/authentication system for posting and voting.

A SQLite database storing posts, comments, votes, and reports.

Documentation, including: How to run the app locally, Project design and architecture overview, & User guide for main features.

Testing:

Unit tests for backend routes (posts, votes, reports).

Manual testing of the UI.

## **Success Criteria:**
[Define what will make this project successful. Examples include meeting deadlines, delivering core functionality, or achieving performance benchmarks.]

## **Assumptions:**
[List any assumptions about the technology, users, or resources that could impact development.]

## **Risks:**
[Identify potential risks and challenges, such as technical limitations, resource constraints, or dependency issues.]

## **Design / Architectural Review:**
[Outline the initial thoughts on application architecture. Will it be monolithic or microservices? Will it use a database? What major components will be included?]

## **Test Environment:**
[Define how the application will be tested. Will you use automated tests? What environment will the tests run in?]
