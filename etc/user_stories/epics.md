## What to Build First

### Phase 1 - The Basics
1. Account stuff (need this first)
2. Posting internships (main feature)
3. Make sure it works on phone

### Phase 2 - Community Features  
4. Voting system
5. Comments

### Phase 3 - Nice to Have
6. Search and filters
7. Better moderation tools

## How We'll Know if It's Working
- Do people actually sign up?

- Do the votes make sense?
- Are people using comments?
- Is search helping people find stuff?
- Are mods keeping up with reports?
- Is the site fast enough?

**Notes:**
- These might change as we work on the project
- Should probably test with real students
- Some of this stuff might be harder than we think
- Need to make sure we don't over-engineer things
